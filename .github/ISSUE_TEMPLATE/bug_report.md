Please provide the information requested below to make your bug report as useful as possible.

1. **rinohtype crashes**: include its output in this bug report
2. **rinohtype's output is wrong** (e.g. bad layout): include the produced PDF and describe what you think is wrong

In **both cases**, please provide a link to the **source files** (e.g. Sphinx project) so that we can reproduce the bug. Without this, it would take too much time to reproduce the bug. If you cannot share the source files publicly, try to create dummy input files that reproduces the bug (may be difficult). Alternatively, you can send the input files to us privately. Look for an email address in the main [readme](https://github.com/brechtm/rinohtype#rinohtype).

Please also provide the following information:
* rinohtype version: (output from `rinoh --version`)
* Sphinx version: (output from `sphinx-build --version`)
* Python version: (output from `python --version`)
* operating system:
